# Video Weblog's Data Cleansing

A website contains a weblog which records everything a visitor has clicked on their site. We want to analyze the traffic in video-related webpages, but the weblog logs data in a non-standardized way. Hence, the purpose of this project is to perform a data cleansing on the weblog containing unstandardized data, before loading only the video-related data into the database table in order to further analyze the video-related webpages.
